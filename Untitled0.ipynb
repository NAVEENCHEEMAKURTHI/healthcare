Definitions.\n","         \n","         A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\n","         Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\n","         interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\n","         on the Runtime Library.\n","         \n","         \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\n","         modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\n","         the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\n","         subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n","         \n","         \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\n","         modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\n","         the license of GCC.\n","         \n","         \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\n","         target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\n","         input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\n","         phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\n","         format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\n","         for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n","         \n","         The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\n","         non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\n","         Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\n","         use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\n","         part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\n","         understood as starting with the output of the generators or\n","         preprocessors.\n","         \n","         A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\n","         with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\n","         work based on GCC.
